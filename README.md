# InceGauss
InceGauss is a Mathematica package that implements the Ince polynomials and the Ince-Gauss beams, as described in the papers:

- Exactly solvable model behind Bose-Hubbard dimers, Ince-Gauss beams, and aberrated optical cavities. R. Gutiérrez-Cuevas, D.H.J. O'Dell, M.R. Dennis, and M.A. Alonso, [*Physical Review A* **107**, L031502 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.L031502).
